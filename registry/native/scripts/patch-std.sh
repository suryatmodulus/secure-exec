# patch-std.sh — Apply wasmVM patches to the Rust std source tree
#
# Patches modify the WASI platform implementation in std to support
# process spawning, pipes, user/group IDs, and terminal detection
# via custom host_process/host_user WASM imports.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/patch-std.sh [--check] [--reverse]
#
# Options:
#   --check    Dry-run: verify patches apply cleanly without modifying files
#   --reverse  Reverse (unapply) previously applied patches

# Install companion source files that a patch declares (e.g. `pub mod process;`)
# but cannot reliably carry inline: a `diff`/`patch` cannot create a brand-new
# file in the std source from a `/dev/null` hunk reliably across patch versions
# (the hunk is silently skipped, leaving the declared module with no source file
# and a `file not found for module` E0583 build error). Convention mirrors the
# vendored-crate mechanism in patch-vendor.sh: `patches/copy.manifest` with lines
# "<src-relative-to-PATCHES_DIR> <dest-relative-to-STD_SRC>". Example:
# `std/os/wasi/process.rs library/std/src/os/wasi/process.rs` installs the public
# wasi child-pipe fd traits that 0007-wasi-childpipe-fd.patch's `pub mod process;`
# references. Without this the patched std fails to compile (missing module).
