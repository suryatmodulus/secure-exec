# @secure-exec/google-drive

Declarative Google Drive native mount helper for secure-exec VMs. This package keeps
the public helper surface on the TypeScript side while routing first-party
Google Drive-backed filesystems through the native `google_drive` sidecar
plugin.

## Usage

```ts
import { createGoogleDriveBackend } from "@secure-exec/google-drive";

export const googleDriveMount = {
  path: "/data",
  plugin: createGoogleDriveBackend({
    credentials: {
      clientEmail: "...",
      privateKey: "...",
    },
    folderId: "your-google-drive-folder-id",
  }),
};
```

## Configuration

| Option | Type | Required | Description |
|--------|------|----------|-------------|
| `credentials` | `{ clientEmail: string; privateKey: string }` | Yes | Google service account credentials |
| `folderId` | `string` | Yes | Google Drive folder ID where blocks are stored |
| `keyPrefix` | `string` | No | Optional prefix for the persisted manifest and block file names |
| `chunkSize` | `number` | No | Optional persisted block chunk size used by the native plugin |
| `inlineThreshold` | `number` | No | Optional maximum inline file size stored in the manifest before chunking |

## Rate Limits

Google Drive API has a rate limit of approximately 10 queries/sec/user. Heavy
I/O workloads may experience throttling. Consider larger `chunkSize` values for
write-heavy workloads so the native plugin emits fewer Drive API calls.
