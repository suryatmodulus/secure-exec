//! Regression test for issue #1:
//! "WASI fdOpen permission check typo (read blocked as write)".
//!
//! The original bug computed write-intent from the READ rights bit
//! (`rightsBase & 2n`, where `2n` == WASI_RIGHT_FD_READ == `1n << 1n`).
//! That meant a pure read open (which sets RIGHT_FD_READ) was treated as a
//! write and rejected with EACCES/EROFS on read-only or isolated tiers.
//!
//! The fix is that write-intent is derived from RIGHT_FD_WRITE
//! (`1n << 6n` == 64n) instead. The WASI module JS that performs `path_open`
//! lives in `crates/execution/assets/runners/wasi-module.js`, and the delegated
//! runner path lives in `crates/execution/assets/runners/wasm-runner.mjs`.
//!
//! `build_wasm_runner_bootstrap` is a private function, so rather than execute
//! it we pin the source-level invariant: write-intent MUST be checked against
//! the WRITE bit and MUST NOT be checked against the READ bit. This locks out
//! reintroducing the typo. If the buggy `& 2n` / READ-bit write check ever
//! returns, this test fails.
