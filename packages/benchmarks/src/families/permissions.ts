// - fs: default deny, then 15 allow glob rules. Common runtime paths appear
//   first; benchmark script and op working paths are last-matching for their
//   requests so the last-match evaluator walks the list.
// - network: default deny, then 5 allowlist rules. The real loopback rule is
//   last so TCP connect/listen checks walk the list before allowing.
// - childProcess/process/env: allow, keeping the benchmark focused on the
//   guest syscall permission matcher for fs and network operations.
