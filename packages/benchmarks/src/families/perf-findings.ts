/**
 * Perf-finding regression ops.
 *
 * Each op exercises one hot-path anti-pattern surfaced by the 2026-06-30
 * perf-slop scan (see ~/progress/secure-exec/2026-06-30-fuzz-perf-optimization-report/
 * perf-slop-scan.md). The `program` runs identically under host Node and inside
 * the guest VM, so `tax.emulation = guest.p50 / node.p50` is the guest overhead
 * the corresponding fix is expected to shrink. Capture these numbers BEFORE the
 * fix lands (baseline) and re-run AFTER (regression guard).
 *
 * Findings already covered by existing benches (no op here):
 *   - host_call.rs:429/435/452/534 (per-syscall lock + String clone) -> sync-bridge-floor
 *   - bridge.rs:1978 (args buffer clone)                             -> sync-bridge-floor --payload-bytes=65536
 *   - execution.rs:897 (loopback peer-pairing 50x10ms retry)         -> net/tcp_connect_close
 *
 * Findings that could NOT be turned into a clean guest-vs-node op (documented so
 * the gap is explicit, not silently dropped):
 *   - v8_host.rs:296 (serialize->deserialize per stream event): stdout/stderr IS
 *     the harness data channel, so flooding the stdio event path overruns the
 *     4096 sidecar event buffer and hangs instead of timing. Needs a
 *     sidecar-internal per-event counter.
 *   - execution.rs:962 (byte-by-byte loopback-TLS read): a guest HTTPS loopback
 *     request currently ERRORS (`ERR_SECURE_EXEC_NODE_SYNC_RPC: loopback TLS transport
 *     read`), so there is no successful transfer to time. The error on that exact
 *     path is itself worth a follow-up.
 *   - execution.rs:19315/19895 (HTTP/2 accept + backpressure polls): node:http2
 *     inside the guest hangs (unsupported), so no request completes to time.
