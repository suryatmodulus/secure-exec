/**
 * Vendor the WASM coreutils/shell command binaries into `@secure-exec/core`'s
 * package directory so they ship inside the published tarball.
 *
 * The kernel needs a guest `sh` (plus coreutils) to spawn any process — without
 * these binaries `NodeRuntime.create()` cannot boot. The binaries are produced
 * by the in-repo Rust command build at
 * `registry/native/target/wasm32-wasip1/release/commands/`. That path only
 * exists in a developer checkout, so we copy the whole command set (symlinks
 * included, the way `bash -> sh` and the stub aliases are laid out) into
 * `packages/core/commands/`, which is listed in `files` and resolved at runtime
 * by `node-runtime.ts` for published installs.
 *
 * This mirrors how the sidecar binary ships via `@secure-exec/sidecar`: the
 * artifact is vendored into a published package and resolved from the installed
 * package at runtime, never from an in-repo build path.
