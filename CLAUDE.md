# secure-exec

secure-exec is the fully virtualized runtime extracted from Agent OS. The kernel provides a POSIX-like VM with a virtual filesystem, process table, socket table, pipes, PTYs, permission policy, and managed language runtimes.

## Trust Model

secure-exec is a sandbox: it runs untrusted code safely for a trusted caller. Decide which side of this boundary something is on before judging whether it is a security bug. Three components:

- **Client** (trusted, *except for anything it submits for execution*). The party that speaks the sidecar wire protocol. The client process and every value it sends are trusted: `CreateVmConfig`, mount descriptors and their plugin configs (host_dir paths, S3 endpoints/credentials, Google Drive, sandbox-agent), the permission policy, network allowlist, resource limits, env, and DNS overrides. Configuration is **not** an attack surface. The one thing from the client that is *not* trusted is the code/payload it asks to run, because that runs in the executor.
- **Sidecar** (trusted; the TCB and the enforcement point). Brokers client requests and owns the kernel, VFS, mount/plugin registry, socket table, and permission policy. It is responsible for enforcing the boundary against the executor.
- **Executor** — V8 isolates or WASM (untrusted; the adversary). Runs guest JS/Python/WASM plus any third-party/npm/agent-generated code. Assume everything here is actively hostile. How code reached the executor never makes it trusted.

**The security boundary is sidecar ↔ executor.** The runtime must stop guest code in the executor from: escaping the kernel boundary (real host fs/network/process/memory), bypassing the *applied* permission policy/allowlist/limits, exhausting host resources beyond configured bounds, or reading another VM's state.

**A defect that requires the client to supply a malicious config/endpoint/credential/policy is NOT a sandbox vulnerability** — the client is configuring its own VM and already controls the host. Treat such hardening as defense-in-depth, not as an escape, and do not add validation that only guards trusted client-provided configuration.

Two corollaries that are easy to get wrong:

- *Trusted policy, untrusted subject.* The permission policy and limits are trusted input, but the guest executor is the subject they bind. "Guest bypasses an applied permission / egress rule / resource cap" is in-scope and serious. Trusted = who sets the rule; untrusted = who is bound by it.
- *Trusted mount, untrusted traffic.* A host-backed mount (host_dir, s3, …) comes from trusted config, so its existence/target/credentials are not attack surface, but the guest drives I/O through it, so confining those guest operations to the mount root (symlink / `..` / TOCTOU / path-aliasing escapes) is in-scope.

**Transport scope.** The wire protocol is same-version lockstep and single-client over stdio (one trusted client per sidecar process). There is no second, mutually-distrusting client, so wire-level authn/authz-between-clients and VM-to-VM access via forged connection ids are out of scope until a multi-client transport exists.

## Runtime Invariants

- All guest code must execute inside the kernel isolation boundary with zero host escapes.
- No runtime may spawn unsandboxed host processes, touch real host filesystems, open real host network sockets, or call real Node.js builtins for guest work.
- Guest JavaScript runs in V8 isolates through `crates/v8-runtime/`; never use `Command::new("node")` for guest execution.
- Every guest syscall goes through kernel-owned VFS, process, socket, pipe, PTY, permission, and DNS paths.
- **Behave like native Linux (load-bearing).** The VM must look and behave like a normal Linux machine to the guest: real subprocesses, sockets, PTYs, pipes, devices (`/dev/null`, …), a normal stdin/stdout lifecycle, and a complete-enough node/libc surface. The Workers-style in-process isolation is *how* we deliver that, never an excuse for the guest to see a degraded environment. When a tool, agent CLI, registry binary, or ported program misbehaves, the default diagnosis is "the runtime is not yet emulating Linux faithfully" and the fix lives **here** — a host bridge, a libc/std patch, a crate stub, a node-API shim, a device emulation — not a workaround in the caller (env flags, binary patches, node-API fakes in adapters, `#[cfg(target_os = "wasi")]` feature gates). Guest-side workarounds are suspected runtime bugs to drive down; only genuine third-party packaging quirks and intentional isolation properties (bounded memory/CPU, default-deny egress) are legitimate exceptions, and those get documented with the reason.
- **Build native programs with the custom libc + Rust toolchain, not bare wasi.** Programs in `registry/native` compile as normal Linux programs against the patched std sysroot + host bridges (`wasi-spawn`, `wasi-http`, `wasi-pty`), via `make -C registry/native wasm`. Never `cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1` raw and never gate out subprocess/socket/git/shell features because "wasi can't" — supply the capability through a bridge/stub/patch. The only allowed platform concession is single-threaded execution (no OS threads).

## Limits, Bounds & Observability

Every bound that protects a shared resource — memory/heap, CPU/wall-clock, fd/process/socket/pipe/pty counts, filesystem bytes/inodes, queue/buffer capacities, payload/frame sizes, timeouts, registration counts — MUST satisfy all of the following. A new `MAX_*`/`*_LIMIT`/`*_CAPACITY`/timeout/cap added without them is incomplete.

- **Bounded by default.** Never `None`/`0`/unbounded (matches the Workers-style memory/CPU rule). Operators may raise a cap; they don't get an unbounded default. If a `0`/`None` genuinely means "engine default" (e.g. Pyodide old-space), say so in the inventory rationale.
- **Config-wired + audited.** Operator-tunable bounds flow through `VmLimits` → `vm-config` (`limits_struct!`, Rust is the single source; TS mirrors via ts-rs). Every limit-shaped constant is classified in `crates/sidecar/tests/fixtures/limits-inventory.json` as `policy` (must name its `wired` config path) / `policy-deferred` / `invariant`, enforced by `crates/sidecar/tests/limits_audit.rs`. Never let a hardcoded operator bound accumulate uncatalogued.
- **Registered for observability.** Register the bound with the central limit tracker (`secure_exec_bridge::queue_tracker`, generalizing to a limit registry) so usage/high-water are inspectable and it emits a **structured, edge-triggered warning as it approaches** (default ≥80% fill, re-arm <50%) naming the limit, observed/cap, fill%, and the `wired` config path. Note: the sidecar tracing level must be at least `WARN` for these to surface (`ERROR`-only swallows them).
- **Clear, typed error on breach.** Fail with a typed error that names the limit and the observed-vs-cap value **with units**, plus how to raise it: `"<limit> exceeded: <observed><unit> > <cap><unit> (raise via limits.<wired>)"`. Map consistently — errno for kernel limits (but attach the limit name; no bare/opaque `EAGAIN`), `ExecutionAbortReason` for runtime kills, `SidecarError`/codec errors for config/protocol. No generic "invalid"/silent failure that hides which limit fired.
- **No catastrophic reaction to transient fullness.** A full bounded queue/buffer applies **backpressure** (block the producer until the consumer drains) or returns the named error — never silently drop, silently evict, destroy the session, or crash the process. Raising a capacity is not a fix by itself; the warning + typed error must exist first. See PR #123 (event channel + stdout frame queue) for the reference pattern; audit every other channel/`VecDeque`/buffer against it.

## Performance

- **No expensive objects per-call.** Build once, reuse via a pool/persistent worker. Never construct per-operation: Tokio runtime, OS thread, V8 isolate/snapshot, DNS resolver, HTTP client, connection pool. Construct-then-teardown every call IS the bug.
- **No serialize→deserialize in-process.** Pass the typed struct directly; wire encoding is for the wire only. Don't encode a frame to bytes only to re-parse it into a command.
- **No whole-buffer copies per I/O.** Use chunked `Vec<u8>` + `extend_from_slice`, not byte-by-byte fills; move/`Arc`/slice payloads — never clone a record that carries its full buffer on each read/write.
- **No per-call allocs/locks/clones** on the sync hot path.
- **Avoid polling**, prefer readiness/event-driven. But a read-probe can be load-bearing for protocol correctness — measure before removing one, and keep its semantic test.
- **No baseline, no merge.** Capture native + unoptimized numbers BEFORE touching code, gate every change on a measured before/after delta, and keep it measure-gated.
- **Revert no-wins.** A change with a flat or negative delta is a liability, not a win.
- **Perf must not regress correctness.** Respect existing caps/bounds and land the regression test in the same change as the optimization.

## Benchmarks

- **Purpose:** `packages/benchmarks` owns the differential matrix for the runtime surface. It compares four lanes: native (host Rust `crates/native-baseline`), node (host Node.js), vm-js (guest V8 Node emulation), and vm-wasm (`native-baseline` compiled to `wasm32-wasip1` and run in the VM). `guest/node` is JS-emulation tax, `wasm/native` is WASM-runtime tax, and `node/native` is Node's own cost.
- **Memory columns:** matrix rows carry `mem`/`memTax` columns, with guest-backed lanes measured above the prewarmed-sidecar baseline.
- **Ecosystem family:** `BENCH_FAMILIES=ecosystem` is command-pair only: `hostCmd` (host binary) vs `vmCmd` (VM WASM command), with `tax.command = vmCmd/hostCmd`.
- **Permissions family:** `BENCH_FAMILIES=permissions` is a guest policy-overhead A/B over hot fs+net ops, reporting `policyTax = policy_p50 / allow_p50`.
- **Layout:** matrix families and the lane engine live in `packages/benchmarks/src`; Rust op implementations live in `crates/native-baseline` and build for both host and wasm. Run one family with `BENCH_FAMILIES=fs pnpm --dir packages/benchmarks bench:matrix` or through `bash packages/benchmarks/run-benchmarks.sh`; results land in `packages/benchmarks/results/`.
- **Verify work:** every op must verify its payload or side effect, so a fast-but-broken path fails instead of passing.
- **Clock discipline:** guest clocks are 1ms-quantized by default for security. Bench VMs opt in to `jsRuntime.highResolutionTime`, or the op must amplify by call count.
- **Unsupported cells:** unsupported lane/op cells are explicit and never silently dropped.
- **Baselines:** regenerate baselines only on a canonical environment, with hardware and dependency metadata recorded.
- **Bench gate:** `packages/benchmarks/results/baseline-local.json` is the canonical-machine baseline; `baseline-ci.json` is GitHub-runner-specific and bootstrapped from the nightly artifact before PR gates enforce it.
- **Merge rule:** a perf fix whose row does not move gets reverted, matching the Performance section.
- **Keep them current:** the benches are a maintained surface, not a one-off audit. New runtime surface (a syscall, a polyfill module, an executor capability, a registry command tier) needs a matrix op or focused lane in the same change or a filed follow-up; perf-relevant changes to existing surface must re-run the affected rows and update coverage when the shape changes (new lanes, renamed ops). If a bench stops compiling or a lane can no longer run, fix or explicitly skip it with a reason — never delete coverage silently.
- **Agent OS boundary:** agent-os keeps product-surface benches only (session tax, ACP) and consumes this framework.

## Project Boundaries

- Keep the secure-exec runtime Agent OS-agnostic: no ACP, sessions, `agentos-protocol`, `agentos-client`, or `agentos-sidecar` dependencies in runtime code.
- Packaged agent definitions/adapters live in `registry/agent/*`; generic VM software lives in `registry/software/*`.
- `crates/bridge/` is the browser/native portability seam. Shared contracts belong there.
- `crates/vfs/` is generic filesystem infrastructure: POSIX-style in-memory/overlay/mount/root engines plus generic chunked/object engines and in-memory stores. It must stay free of secure-exec sidecar, bridge, S3, SQLite, and host-disk coupling.
- `crates/secure-exec-vfs/` contains concrete secure-exec filesystem backends: S3 adapters, host-disk SQLite/file stores, and bridge/callback-backed metadata stores. Policy decisions, config validation, and mount descriptor parsing stay in sidecar plugins.
- `crates/execution/` is the native execution implementation and must not become the browser portability layer.
- `crates/sidecar/` builds the `secure-exec-sidecar` crate and binary. Extension APIs must stay transport-agnostic.
- The protocol has no backwards compatibility. The sidecar and its clients run in same-version lockstep, so never add protocol or config versioning, runtime negotiation, fallbacks, or converters. Wire types and configs such as `CreateVmConfig` carry no `version` field beyond the single same-version handshake. Change the protocol freely and update all sides together.
- Wire/client parity: every capability implemented in the wire protocol must be reachable from BOTH client APIs — the TypeScript client (`NodeRuntime` / `secure-exec`) and the Rust client. When you add or change a protocol capability, expose it on both; never leave wire functionality unreachable from the TS or Rust API.
- Config travels on the **BARE wire/structured request**, not the ambient `AGENTOS_*` env channel. Classify every setting into three buckets: (1) **process-wide / host / build / test → env** (shared across all VMs, not per-VM configurable); (2) **per-VM bootstrap-before-wire → env carve-out** (must exist at `exec` time before the wire/sync-RPC bridge is up: sandbox root, inherited bridge fds, entrypoint/payload); (3) **per-VM runtime config → BARE wire** (anything per-VM the established wire/bridge could carry — limits, virtualized identity, isolation policy). New per-VM settings default to bucket 3. Migrated so far: resource limits + virtualized identity (`process.*` via the runtime shim, `os.*` via the `__agentOSVirtualOs` global). Isolation policy (guest path mappings, extra fs read/write paths, allowed Node builtins, loopback-exempt ports, WASM permission tier) is still on env — bucket 3 but not yet moved. Anti-pattern: a value carried on the wire then silently re-emitted as an env knob (and maybe never read) is the **dead-cap** failure mode — if it's on the wire, the engine must read it from the wire path, never from a duplicated env var. See `crates/sidecar/CLAUDE.md` for the rule.
- JavaScript host-emulation config (`CreateVmConfig.jsRuntime`) mirrors esbuild's vocabulary so users carry over a known mental model. The host environment presented to guest JS is a `platform`; its values are esbuild's exactly — `node` | `browser` | `neutral` — plus the one sanctioned extension `bare` (language-only: ECMAScript spec globals + WebAssembly, nothing host-provided), for which esbuild has no equivalent. Do not invent other platform names. Wherever a JS runtime/resolution config property has an esbuild equivalent, take esbuild's name and value spelling over any other source (esbuild > tsconfig > ad-hoc); introduce a non-esbuild name only when esbuild has no equivalent concept (e.g. `moduleResolution`, `allowedBuiltins`).
- `packages/core/` is `@secure-exec/core`, the generic TypeScript protocol, client, descriptor, and runtime asset package.
- `packages/build-tools/` is `@secure-exec/build-tools`, the workspace-only generator package for V8 bridge and base filesystem assets. A fresh checkout must run `pnpm install` before any `cargo` build (including when a downstream like agent-os path-deps these crates): `v8-runtime/build.rs` generates the V8 bridge assets from `packages/build-tools/node_modules` and panics if they are absent.
- Registry software, filesystem, and tool packages live under `registry/` with the `@secure-exec/*` npm scope.

## Build And Assets

- The VM base filesystem artifact is derived from Alpine Linux, but runtime source should stay generic.
- Rebuild the base filesystem (requires Docker) with `pnpm --dir packages/build-tools build:base-filesystem`. The one script snapshots Alpine, applies the secure-exec transforms, and writes the single canonical `packages/core/fixtures/base-filesystem.json`, mirroring the same bytes into the crate-vendored `crates/sidecar/assets/` and `crates/vfs/assets/` copies (those exist only as the `cargo publish` fallback; never hand-edit them).
- The V8 bridge bundle is generated from `packages/build-tools/scripts/build-v8-bridge.mjs`; keep its generated assets aligned with bridge-contract changes.
- `registry/native` owns the Rust-to-WASM command build; package-local `registry/software/*/wasm/` output is release material.

## npm Compatibility

- npm packages must work unmodified inside the VM. Fix module resolution or polyfills instead of bundling or patching published packages.
- Never hardcode support for specific npm packages in secure-exec. Do not special-case package names (e.g. `minimatch`, `glob`, `undici`) in module resolution, format detection, export synthesis, polyfills, or interop. When a real package exposes a general gap, fix the underlying mechanism so every package benefits; a package-name branch is a sign the real bug is elsewhere. The only allowed name-based handling is for Node.js builtins (e.g. `node:fs`), never third-party packages.
- The VM presents mounted `node_modules` faithfully, like a real filesystem (Docker-style), symlinks included. Module resolution must match naive Node.js resolution over that filesystem — the ancestor `node_modules` walk, `exports`/`imports`/conditions, and `realpath`/symlink following — and nothing more.
- No package-manager-specific resolution heuristics. The resolver must not understand pnpm/yarn internals — e.g. no scanning the `.pnpm` virtual store or guessing a version when no symlink points to it. pnpm/yarn layouts resolve because the VFS exposes their symlinks, not because the resolver special-cases them. If a real layout fails, fix VFS symlink fidelity (or `exports`/conditions handling), never add a layout-aware shortcut.
- Use `node-stdlib-browser` for pure-JS builtins and bridge-backed polyfills for kernel-backed modules such as `fs`, `net`, `child_process`, `dns`, `http`, `os`, and `crypto`.
- Guest `fetch()` must run through undici inside the V8 isolate, then through the kernel socket table.

## Native Binary Distribution

- Ship `secure-exec-sidecar` through `@secure-exec/sidecar` plus platform packages declared as optional dependencies.
- Publish platform binary packages with `npm publish`, not `pnpm publish`, so executable bits are preserved.
- Resolver packages must return an absolute binary path. Callers pass that typed path to process spawning instead of relying on global environment mutation.

## Development

### Release Tracks

- **secure-exec runtime** — `@secure-exec/*` npm packages and `secure-exec-*` crates; releases keep npm/crates in sync, previews are npm-only. See "Preview-publishing" and "Publishing" for details.
- **`@agentos-software/*` registry packages** — generic VM software from secure-exec `registry/software/*` plus agent adapters from secure-exec `registry/agent/*`; versioned independently of secure-exec runtime packages.
- **agent-os product/API** — `@rivet-dev/agentos*`, AgentOs APIs, sidecar wrapper, docs, quickstarts, and examples; see agent-os `CLAUDE.md` for its pinning workflow.

### Preview-publishing

Dispatch `.github/workflows/publish.yaml` (workflow_dispatch) with no version input to cut a **preview** (debug sidecar build, npm-only, dist-tag = sanitized branch name) — for handing a build to a downstream (agent-os) or external project. **Preview-publish is for previews ONLY; never cut a release with it.** Caveats: WASM-bearing packages (`@secure-exec/core`, `@agentos-software/*`) publish MANUALLY (see Publishing), and the crates.io job is skipped on preview — a *crate* change only reaches consumers locally (path dep / `[patch]`) or via a real release.

### Testing a local build from an external project (same machine)

- **npm:** `pnpm -r build`, then `pnpm pack` the package and `npm install ./secure-exec-core-*.tgz` in the external project (or a `link:`/`file:` override). `@secure-exec/core` needs its WASM commands vendored first (`make -C registry/native wasm`; its `prepack` fails loud if absent).
- **cargo:** add a path dep or `[patch.crates-io]` override in the external Cargo project, e.g. `[patch.crates-io] secure-exec-sidecar = { path = "/abs/path/secure-exec/crates/sidecar" }`. A fresh checkout needs `pnpm install` first (V8 bridge assets — see Project Boundaries).

## Publishing

- **The `@secure-exec/*` npm packages and the `secure-exec-*` Cargo crates are always published at the same version** (npm and crates stay in sync), so a downstream pins both to one `<v>`. See "Release Tracks" for how this differs from `@agentos-software/*` and agent-os releases.
- CI (`.github/workflows/publish.yaml`) does NOT build or publish the WASM command binaries. There is no `build-commands` job and nothing restores a `wasm-commands` artifact — the workflow only builds/publishes the sidecar binary and the pure-TS packages.
- WASM-bearing packages are ALWAYS published MANUALLY: `@secure-exec/core` (which vendors `registry/native` commands into `packages/core/commands` via `copy-wasm-commands.mjs`, guarded by its `prepack --require`) and the `@agentos-software/*` registry software. `@secure-exec/core` is in `EXCLUDED` in `scripts/publish/src/lib/packages.ts`, so CI never publishes it.
- Manual core flow: build the commands locally (`make -C registry/native wasm`), then `npm publish` (not `pnpm publish`) `@secure-exec/core` at the **same version** CI used for that release so dependents resolving `@secure-exec/core@<version>` succeed. `prepack` vendors the commands and fails loud if they are absent.
- Rationale: building WASM in CI was slow/flaky and repeatedly shipped tarballs missing the command set (the `wasm/` output is a gitignored build artifact). Keeping the WASM publish manual makes the vendored command set authoritative and avoids empty-package regressions.

## Website

- `website/` is `@secure-exec/website`, a unified Astro app serving the public site at **secureexec.dev**: `/` is the React/Tailwind landing page and `/docs/*` is the Starlight documentation.
- External/consumer usage (installing `@secure-exec/core` and using it in your own project) is documented in the website, not in this file. This `CLAUDE.md` is contributor/maintainer-only.
- **Agent OS docs are canonical for agentOS-visible behavior — check them instead of local docs.** Most secure-exec runtime behavior (process lifecycle, limits, permissions, filesystem/network semantics, ACP-adjacent surfaces) reaches users through Agent OS, whose docs live in the agent-os repo (`../agent-os` `website/src/content/docs/`, deployed to `agentos-sdk.dev/docs`), NOT here. When a secure-exec change alters behavior that agentOS consumers can observe, check the agent-os docs for affected pages and keep them up to date in the accompanying agent-os change; the local `website/` documents only the standalone Secure Exec SDK surface.
- Docs are **user-facing, not internals.** Write for a developer *using the SDK*, not for a contributor maintaining the runtime. Every page is framed around how the SDK is used: what you call, what you pass, what you get back, and what behavior to expect. Do not document internal implementation (kernel data structures, isolate plumbing, refactor history); that belongs in code comments or `CLAUDE.md`. When a page must reference a runtime concept (filesystem model, networking, isolation), explain it through the developer-visible API and behavior, show a quick code example, then link out for the deeper reference rather than narrating internals.
- Docs are **bullet-heavy and code-heavy, not prose-heavy.** Default to scannable bullet lists in the `- **Foo**: Bar` form (bolded term, then the one-line explanation) instead of paragraphs. Lead with a code snippet wherever a concept has an API, and link to a runnable example under `examples/docs/*` whenever one exists. Avoid long paragraphs; if you find yourself writing more than two or three sentences in a row, convert it to bullets or a code block. Prose is the exception, used only to connect ideas that genuinely cannot be a list.
- The docs theme matches the Rivet docs (rivet.dev) 1:1: light-only "porcelain" palette, Manrope + JetBrains Mono, dark code blocks.
- Docs prose must not use em dashes (`—`). Rephrase with commas, colons, parentheses, or separate sentences. This applies to all content under `website/src/content/docs`.
- **Docs code blocks MUST embed real example files via `<CodeSnippet>` — never hand-write checked code inline.** All runnable code shown in docs lives as a file under `examples/docs/*` (a real example package, verified end-to-end against the sidecar) and is embedded at build time, so the rendered code is always the exact code we ship, and each block auto-links to its source on GitHub. This **replaces** the old "copy the code verbatim into the page + add a manual `*[See Full Example](…)*` link" convention — `<CodeSnippet>` embeds the source and generates the GitHub link automatically. Authoring:
  - Embed a whole file: `<CodeSnippet file="examples/docs/feat-typescript/src/index.mts" />` (repo-relative path). `remarkCodeSnippet` (in `@rivet-dev/docs-theme`) inlines the content; the language is inferred from the extension (override with `lang=`), the tab label is the basename (override with `title=`).
  - Embed only part of a file with `region="name"`, delimiting it in the source with `// docs:start name` … `// docs:end name` (markers are stripped, the region is dedented).
  - `<CodeSnippet>` is the ONLY embed API. A bare ```` ```ts file="server.ts" ```` fence (no slash) is just a CodeGroup tab label, not an embed.
  - Paths resolve from the repo root (override via `DOCS_EMBED_ROOT`). If the referenced code doesn't exist yet, add it as a proper runnable example under `examples/docs/*` rather than inlining unchecked code.
  - Non-runnable snippets (shell commands, config fragments, illustrative pseudo-code) may stay inline — the rule is about code a reader could copy and run.
  - This convention is owned by the shared `@rivet-dev/docs-theme` and applies to every site built on it (secure-exec AND agent-os).
- Docs styling is owned by the shared **`@rivet-dev/docs-theme`** repo (`github.com/rivet-dev/docs-theme`), consumed via `github:rivet-dev/docs-theme#<tag>` and wired in via `...docsTheme(starlight, siteConfig)` in `astro.config.mjs`. **To change any docs styling** (header, sidebar, code blocks, fonts, palette), edit that repo and follow its CLAUDE.md release workflow — never restyle docs in `website/src`. When iterating on theme styling locally, add a `pnpm.overrides` `link:` to the local docs-theme checkout (kept through local commits while iterating), but **remove it before pushing** — a pushed consumer must pin `github:rivet-dev/docs-theme#<tag>`, never a path. To change *this site's* identity/nav/sidebar/landing, edit `website/docs.config.mjs` (sidebar icons via each item's `attrs['data-icon']`). Re-test with `pnpm --dir website build`.

- The proper product title is **"Secure Exec"** (two words, capitalized); use it in docs PROSE. Use the lowercase "secure-exec" only for code identifiers, package names (`@secure-exec/*`), the repo, and URLs.

## Version Control (jj)

- This checkout is jj colocated (jj over git). Prefer `jj` for commits/branches; avoid `git commit`/`git checkout`, which fight jj's working-copy commit.
- Large pyodide/sandbox assets exceed jj's default snapshot size limit. Commit them with `jj --config snapshot.max-new-file-size=16777216 ...`, or gitignore them.
- **Commit titles and PR titles are pure conventional commits** (`feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, etc.) with an optional scope, e.g. `fix(sidecar): handle empty ack batch`. Never indicate that a change was written by a coding agent: no model name, no agent name, no `[SLOP(...)]` prefix, and no `Co-Authored-By:` or `Generated with` trailer. The title must read exactly as a human-authored conventional commit. jj descriptions stay single-line.
- **PR descriptions are a simple, high-level bullet list of what changed.** One bullet per meaningful change in plain language. No per-file or line-by-line detail, no implementation narration, and no mention of an agent.

## CLAUDE.md Convention

- Every directory with `CLAUDE.md` must also have `AGENTS.md` as a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`.
- Keep CLAUDE entries concise and limited to design constraints, invariants, and non-obvious rules.
